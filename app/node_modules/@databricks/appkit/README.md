# AppKit

Build Databricks Apps faster with our brand-new Node.js + React SDK. Built for humans and AI.

## Introduction

AppKit is a TypeScript SDK for building production-ready Databricks applications with a plugin-based architecture. It provides opinionated defaults, built-in observability, and seamless integration with Databricks services.

AppKit simplifies building data applications on Databricks by providing:

- **Plugin architecture**: Modular design with built-in server and analytics plugins
- **Type safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with automatic query type generation
- **Production-ready features**: Built-in caching, telemetry, retry logic, and error handling
- **Developer experience**: Remote hot reload, file-based queries, optimized for AI-assisted development
- **Databricks native**: Seamless integration with SQL Warehouses, Unity Catalog, and other workspace resources

## Plugins

AppKit's power comes from its plugin system. Each plugin adds a focused capability to your app with minimal configuration.

- **Analytics Plugin** — Query your Lakehouse data directly from your app. Define SQL queries as files, execute them against Databricks SQL Warehouses, and get automatic caching, parameterization, and on-behalf-of user execution out of the box.
- **Genie Plugin** — Conversational AI interface powered by Databricks AI/BI Genie. Let users ask natural language questions against your data and get answers with automatic chart inference and visualization.
- **Files Plugin** — Browse, upload, and manage files in Unity Catalog Volumes. Supports multiple volumes, content type validation, and on-behalf-of user access.
- **Lakebase Plugin** — OLTP database operations against Databricks Lakebase with automatic OAuth token management. Returns a standard `pg.Pool` compatible with Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, and other ORMs.
